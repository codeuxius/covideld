# COVID-19 EL Data

## An Introduction

The purpose of this project is to parse COVID-19 related information provided on a daily basis by the Greek National Public Helath Organization (NPHO) in the form of a "daily report" (PDF file) and to convert it to machine-redable data.

With the help of plain Bash scripting and Python, getting some usable CSVs was easily doable, although NPHO is constantly altering the structure of the PDFs for no apparent reason and thus things tend to break -way too- often. In addition, the PDFs have no apparent license and thus it's unclear if they could be considered "open data". Regardless, **personal risk assessment is crucial** during the pandemic and is (wisely) advised by WHO (see quote bellow) and therefore, the existence of this data in an easily digestable format for both humans and machines is a necessity.

>"Every person needs to look at (their) own risk. You need to be aware of what is the local transmission, you need to know what the transmission in (your) area is. We do this in our lives as human beings, we manage risk, we decide when we cross the road (...) What we need is the information to make those risk-based decisions. We need to gain the knowledge to make good decisions. We decide on our proximity to other individuals. We decide on the intensity of our social engagement. We decide how long we spend in that environment. We can be advised by government, we can be advised by science, but in the end this comes down to personal motivation and personal choice"

As the actual code is still a mess and the project is proving to be way too difficult to maintain on a daily-basis, this repository acts mainly for the time being as a proof-of-concept and also as a plea for more open data, freely shared by our governments. So far, 3 CSVs with the most important data and 2 related R graphs (very big and very pretty, IMHO) are included.

## Caveats

1. Prior to Dec 16, 2020, NPHO's report didn't include any data on cases per administrative regional unit (περιφερειακές ενότητες). Still, that data was included on a daily digital press briefing, which was forwarded to every single media outlet in the country, which in turn reposted it. There were many issues with that briefing as it didn't even include all the regional units. For example, Attica was included as a whole Region and thus couldn't be compared to the smaller regional units. In addition, a few cases during that period were not even assigned to a regional unit and thus they were put under the "unknown origin" column. 
2. Prior to Sep 7, 2020, the press briefings included weird and outdated regional divisions. For example, the briefings reported data for the Cyclades and Dodecanese areas, although these are not even administrative regional units. Although that data was archived, it's not included in this dataset as every single day would require it's own README.md. Even after Sep 7, 2020 some notes were still necessary and those were included in the CSV.
3. It's a well known fact that the pandemic ceases to exist on Easter day.

Stay safe!
